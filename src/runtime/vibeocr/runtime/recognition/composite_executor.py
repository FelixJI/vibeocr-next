"""CompositeExecutor: route a job to a child executor by ``JobKind``.

The :class:`~vibeocr.runtime.jobs.module.SupervisorModule` takes a single
``Executor``, but the supervisor must run more than one backend (Paddle for
``RECOGNITION`` jobs, MinerU for ``MINERU_PARSE`` jobs). This executor wraps a
list of children and dispatches each job to the first child whose
``handles(record)`` returns True.

It also aggregates ``residency_status`` / ``release_idle`` across children so
the v2 runtime endpoints reflect every loaded pipeline, and picks the
strongest cancel mode offered by any matching child (a queued-only child can
still be cancelled cooperatively if another child handles the kind).
