"""Integration test: v2 supervisor runs REAL Paddle OCR end-to-end.

This proves the plan's Phase 4/8 requirement that the supervisor can actually
execute recognition jobs through the unified seam. It builds a supervisor with
the real ``PaddleExecutor`` (backed by the singleton ``OCRService``), submits
a one-element recognition job carrying a rendered-text image, polls until
terminal, and asserts the returned text contains the expected word.

Heavy: loads PaddlePaddle + the OCR model (~seconds, GBs). Skipped in CI and
on any environment without paddle; run locally with:

    $env:VIBEOCR_RUN_REAL_PADDLE_GATE = "1"
    python -m pytest tests/supervisor/test_paddle_executor_integration.py -m slow

The test is self-contained: it renders the input image with Pillow so there is
no binary fixture dependency.
